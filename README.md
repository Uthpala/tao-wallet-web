# Tao Wallet Web

Learn more about [Remix Stacks](https://github.com/dannydeezy/tao-wallet).

## What's in the stack

This project is using remix blues-stack(https://github.com/remix-run/blues-stack)

## Development Steps

- Clone the project

  ```sh
  git clone git@github.com:Uthpala/tao-wallet-web.git
  ```

- Install Dependencies

  ```sh
  npm install
  ```

- Start the Postgres Database in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started):

  ```sh
  npm run docker
  ```

  > **Note:** The npm script will complete while Docker sets up the container in the background. Ensure that Docker has finished and your container is running before proceeding.

- Initial setup:

  ```sh
  npm run setup
  ```

- Run the first build:

  ```sh
  npm run build
  ```

- Start dev server:

  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

The database seed script creates a new user with some data you can use to get started:

- Email: `rachel@remix.run`
- Password: `racheliscool`

If you'd prefer not to use Docker, you can also use Fly's Wireguard VPN to connect to a development database (or even your production database). You can find the instructions to set up Wireguard [here](https://fly.io/docs/reference/private-networking/#install-your-wireguard-app), and the instructions for creating a development database [here](https://fly.io/docs/reference/postgres/).

### Relevant code:

This is a pretty simple note-taking app, but it's a good example of how you can build a full stack app with Prisma and Remix. The main functionality is creating users, logging in and out, and creating and deleting notes.

- creating users, and logging in and out [./app/models/user.server.ts](./app/models/user.server.ts)
- user sessions, and verifying them [./app/session.server.ts](./app/session.server.ts)
- creating, and deleting notes [./app/models/note.server.ts](./app/models/note.server.ts)
